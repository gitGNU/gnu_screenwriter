<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>On Mac OS</h2>
<p>
If you're on a Mac, you might be familiar with other screenwriting
programs that specialize in doing two things: giving you a headache
over licensing, both in terms of cost and how many devices you're
allowed to use the application on, and the ever-present threat of
locking you out of your data.
</p>

<p>
Screenwriter-mode and Emacs will never do either; GNU Emacs uses plain
text files as its format, so no matter where you are, you'll always be
able to get to your screenplays.  Emacs is owned by you, the user, and
it's designed to be completely multi-platform, so even if you find
yourself on someone's Windows computer (perish the thought), you could
download and use Emacs and screenwriter-mode with a few clicks.  And
while Apple itself has abandoned the "old" PowerPC Macs, GNU Emacs
still supports them.
</p>

<p>Doing stuff on Mac OS is super simple, isn't it?  Sure it is,
  that's why you use a Mac!  With that in mind, the installation
  instructions use few words and mostly pictures.  Follow along!
</p>
  
<h2>1. Installing GNU Emacs</h2>

<p>
Download Emacs from <a
href="http://www.emacsforosx.com">www.EmacsForOSX.com</a> and install it.
</p>

<img src="./macos/installingEmacs.png" />

<p>Place it in your dock so you can find it later:
</p>

<img src="./macos/emacsDock.png" />

<h2>2. Installing Screenwriter</h2>

<p>Download Screenwriter-mode and uncompress it in the Finder.</p>

<p>
Make a new folder for your Emacs extensions:
</p>

<img src="./macos/newFolder.png" />

<p>
And copy the file named screenwriter.el into that new folder: 
</p>

<img src="./macos/installScreenwriter.png" />

<p>
It's installed!  One more step to go.
</p>

<h2>3. Configuring Emacs</h2>

<p>
Launch Emacs (it's in your dock if you're following this tutorial
closely; otherwise, find it in your Applications folder).  Create a
new file with the File menu's <strong>Visit New File</strong> selection.
</p>


<img src="./macos/newFile.png" />
<p>
Notice that at the bottom of the Emacs window, you are asked to name the file you are about to create.  Make sure to name it exactly what is shown in the picture: ~&#47;.emacs
</p>

<img src="./macos/nameFile.png" />

<p>
Copy and paste this into the new file:
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")</p>
<p>(require 'screenwriter)</p>
<p>(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f1&gt;")   'screenwriter-mode)</p>
<p>(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.scp" . screenwriter-mode) auto-mode-alist))</p>
<p>(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.screenplay" . screenwriter-mode) auto-mode-alist))</p>
</div>

<p>Save the file, close Emacs, re-launch it, and start writing screenplays.</p>

<h2>4. Using Screenwriter-mode</h2>

<p>
If you've never used Emacs, you'll find it unique.  Of course,
"unique" hardly makes it difficult; in fact, its unique qualities are
mostly the reasons people have loved and used Emacs for so long.
</p>

<p>
GNU Emacs existed long before popular word processors and graphic
applications, so all of the control-c to copy and control-v to paste
and control-s to save and similar shortcuts you might know? throw them
out.  They weren't even invented when Emacs came around.
</p>

<p>
Emacs uses sequential key shortcuts, logically divided into three main
categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>control-x</strong> for application commands like copy, paste, save, and so
on.</li>
<li><strong>alt-x</strong> (or <strong>escape x</strong> if you don't
have an Alt key) for document commands, like help with formatting, font
styles, bulk text replacement, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>control-c</strong> for special commands that the user may create for their
own use.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've never used Emacs, you should practise a little at the
keyboard shortcuts.  Try hitting <strong>control-x</strong> to see how it places you in
a "command mode" (after you press <strong>control-x</strong>, look down at the bottom
of your Emacs window and you'll notice that Emacs is patiently
awaiting a second key press), and then <strong>control-f</strong> for "Find File",
meaning you wish to open a new file.  Then type in a new name for the
blank document you about to open, and hit return.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you could also just go to the File menu and select "Open" or
"Visit New File".
</p>

<p>
Now that you have a blank document, you can enter screenwriter-mode by
pressing <strong>alt-x</strong> (in Emacs terms they call this <strong>meta-x</strong>, since the Alt
key is not always called an Alt key on all keyboards) and then typing
in screenwriter-mode.
</p>

<p>
Alternately, you could simply press <strong>F1</strong>, since
we've configured Emacs with our .emacs file to assign
<strong>F1</strong> to opening screenwriter-mode.
</p>

<p>
Now that you are in screenwriter-mode, you can use the four
screenwriter commands, which all use <strong>alt</strong> plus a single mnemonic letter:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>alt-s</strong> places you into SLUG LINE entry.</li>
<li><strong>alt-a</strong> places you in an ACTION, or screen
direction, block.</li>
<li><strong>alt-d</strong> places you into a DIALOGUE block.</li>
<li><strong>alt-t</strong> places you into a TRANSITION block.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Usually, you do not need to press RETURN; when you have finished
typing in a block of action, simply press <strong>alt-s d</strong> to
enter dialogue mode, and after the dialogue is finished press
<strong>alt-s a</strong> to get back to action, and so on.
</p>

<p>
To save your document, use <strong>control-x</strong> and <strong>control-s</strong>, or the File menu.
</p>

<p>
If formatting gets confused, then you can correct it with moving your
cursor (with your arrow keys or mouse) to the block of text that is
not properly formatted, and press <strong>control-u</strong> and then
the format style you want to be applied to it, such as <strong>alt-s
a</strong> or whatever.  In other words, if you accidentally typed
some dialogue in as action, move your cursor to the paragraph, press
<strong>control-u</strong> to place you into correction mode, and then
<strong>alt-s d</strong> to re-format.
</p>

<p>
In the end, you should get a screenplay that looks a little something
like this:

<p>
That's about all there is to know about the basics of
screenwriter-mode and GNU Emacs.  Enjoy!
