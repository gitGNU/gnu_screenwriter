<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>On GNU Linux, BSD, and other Unixy Systems</h2>
<p>If you're already running GNU Linux, you are either dirt poor or
  you value your data's freedom, or both.  Welcome to the club!
</p>

<p>
You may also already be familiar with GNU Emacs, or you might not.
  Either way, getting started with Screenwriter-mode is as simple as
  installing Emacs, installing Screenwriter, and writing.
</p>

<h2>1. Installing GNU Emacs</h2>
<p>Emacs is such an ubiquitous companion to Unix and Unix-like systems
  that usually your OS already has a very simple way of installing it,
  if it's not already installed.</p>

<p>So, the short version is to check first if you have Emacs
  installed:</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ which emacs</p>
<p>&#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;emacs</p>
</div>

<p>
If your terminal does return something like &#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;emacs
then yes, you have Emacs installed and can skip to the next step.
Otherwise, you'll need to install Emacs.  One way to do this is to
download Emacs from <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">gnu.org&#47;software&#47;emacs</a>
and install manually.  The more common way is to use your
distribution's package management software.
</p>

<p>If you are using Slackware Linux, the command would be:</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ su -c 'slackpkg install emacs'</p>
</div>

<p>On Red Hat, Fedora, and many others:</p>
<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ su -c 'yum install emacs'</p>
</div>

<p>On Ubuntu, go to the Ubuntu One Store and search for Emacs.</p>

<p>On Linux Mint and other Debian-based distributions (this may also
include you if you are an advanced Ubuntu user) you may use:</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ sudo aptitude install emacs</p>
</div>

<p>On Debian:</p>
<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ su -c 'aptitude install emacs'</p>
</div>

<p>On freeBSD and similar:</p>
<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ cd /usr/ports/editors/emacs23</p>
<p>$ su -c 'make; make install; make clean'</p>
</div>

<p>On Solaris, you can use the <a
href="http://www.blastwave.org">blastwave.org</a> CSW or <a
href="http://www.opencsw.org">openCSW.org</a> collection to install
emacs.
</p>

<h2>2. Installing Screenwriter</h2>

<p>Now that you have Emacs installed, you should launch it just to
establish that it does indeed work.  Launch Emacs from either your
Application menu or from a terminal by typing emacs.
</p>

<p>
Emacs should start.  Yes, it looks just like a normal application!
Not at all the scary, for-advanced-users-only, confusing app that it's
sometimes made out to be, is it?
</p>

<p>
Now that it's launched, quit it by selecting Exit from the File
menu or hitting <strong>control-x</strong> and then <strong>control-c</strong>, in succession.
</p>

<p>To install Screenwriter, you need to download it.  So do that
first.  After you've downloaded it, you should have a
screenwriter.tar.bz2 file somewhere on your computer; uncompress this
by either right-clicking it in your file manager or using the terminal
command 
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>tar -xf screenwriter.tar.bz2</p>
</div>

<p>
Next, create a directory in your home folder for all of your personal
Emacs extensions.  You can call this directory whatever you like; some
people call it <strong>elisp.d</strong>, some people <strong>.elisp</strong>, others <strong>.elisp.d</strong>; whatever.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't matter what you call it but I call it
<strong>elisp</strong> so that's what I'll use here.
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ mkdir ~/elisp</p>
</div>

<p>
Then copy the screenwriter.el file into that directory:
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>$ cp ./screenwriter.el ~/elisp</p>
</div>

<p>
Now it's installed.  But wait! we need to configure a few things first.
</p>

<h2>3. Configuring Emacs</h2>

<p>
Create a file in your home directory (in fact it may already exist) called .emacs and then open it in a text editor:
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
$ touch ~/.emacs
$ emacs ~/.emacs
</div>

<p>
In the .emacs file, you should add at least these lines:
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")</p>
<p>(require 'screenwriter)</p>
<p>(global-set-key (kbd "&gt;f1&lt;")   'screenwriter-mode)</p>
<p>(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.scp" . screenwriter-mode) auto-mode-alist))</p>
<p>(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.screenplay" . screenwriter-mode) auto-mode-alist))</p>
</div>

<p>
Line by line, this means: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Add your personal elisp directory to the path of all instances of
Emacs launched by you.</li>
<li>Make the screenwriter-mode available to Emacs when you hit M-x.  Load the
Screenwriter mode when you hit F1 from within Emacs.</li>
<li>Set Emacs to start screenwriter-mode whenever you open a file ending in .scp or .screenplay</li>
</ul>

<p>Save the file, close Emacs, re-launch it, and start writing screenplays.</p>

<h2>4. Using Screenwriter-mode</h2>

<p>
If you've never used Emacs, you'll find it unique.  Of course,
"unique" hardly makes it difficult; in fact, its unique qualities are
mostly the reasons people have loved and used Emacs for so long.
</p>

<p>
GNU Emacs existed long before popular word processors and graphic
applications, so all of the control-c to copy and control-v to paste
and control-s to save and similar shortcuts you might know? throw them
out.  They weren't even invented when Emacs came around.
</p>

<p>
Emacs uses sequential key shortcuts, logically divided into three main
categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>control-x</strong> for application commands like copy, paste, save, and so
on.</li>
<li><strong>alt-x</strong> (or <strong>escape x</strong> if you don't
have an Alt key) for document commands, like help with formatting, font
styles, bulk text replacement, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>control-c</strong> for special commands that the user may create for their
own use.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've never used Emacs, you should practise a little at the
keyboard shortcuts.  Try hitting <strong>control-x</strong> to see how it places you in
a "command mode" (after you press <strong>control-x</strong>, look down at the bottom
of your Emacs window and you'll notice that Emacs is patiently
awaiting a second key press), and then <strong>control-f</strong> for "Find File",
meaning you wish to open a new file.  Then type in a new name for the
blank document you about to open, and hit return.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you could also just go to the File menu and select "Open" or
"Visit New File".
</p>

<p>
Now that you have a blank document, you can enter screenwriter-mode by
pressing <strong>alt-x</strong> (in Emacs terms they call this <strong>meta-x</strong>, since the Alt
key is not always called an Alt key on all keyboards) and then typing
in screenwriter-mode.
</p>

<p>
Alternately, you could simply press <strong>F1</strong>, since
we've configured Emacs with our .emacs file to assign
<strong>F1</strong> to opening screenwriter-mode.
</p>

<p>
Now that you are in screenwriter-mode, you can use the four
screenwriter commands, which all use <strong>alt</strong> and a single mnemonic letter:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>alt-s</strong> places you into SLUG LINE entry.</li>
<li><strong>alt-a</strong> places you in an ACTION, or screen
direction, block.</li>
<li><strong>alt-d</strong> places you into a DIALOGUE block.</li>
<li><strong>alt-t</strong> places you into a TRANSITION block.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Usually, you do not need to press RETURN; when you have finished
typing in a block of action, simply press <strong>alt-s d</strong> to
enter dialogue mode, and after the dialogue is finished press
<strong>alt-s a</strong> to get back to action, and so on.
</p>

<p>
To save your document, use <strong>control-x</strong> and <strong>control-s</strong>, or the File menu.
</p>

<p>
If formatting gets confused, then you can correct it with moving your
cursor (with your arrow keys or mouse) to the block of text that is
not properly formatted, and press <strong>control-u</strong> and then
the format style you want to be applied to it, such as <strong>alt-s
a</strong> or whatever.  In other words, if you accidentally typed
some dialogue in as action, move your cursor to the paragraph, press
<strong>control-u</strong> to place you into correction mode, and then
<strong>alt-s d</strong> to re-format.
</p>

<p>
That's about all there is to know about the basics of
screenwriter-mode and GNU Emacs.  Enjoy!
