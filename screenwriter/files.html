<h1>Screenwriter-mode</h1>
<h2>File Management</h2>

<p>
Writers often work in one of two ways: either the way that a software
application encourages them to work, or in whatever way they stumble
into.  It wasn't until I got a job as a paid writer that I learned
some amazing techniques that are common among software programmers and
technical writers that us creative types could really learn from.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the screenplay world actually has a lot more in common
with programmers than you'd realize, when you think of how programmers
have to re-write code and send one another changes to existing source
code, much as a screenwriter may have to insert pages or dialogue into
an existing screenplay without having to re-print the entire thing for
the entire cast and crew.
</p>

<p>
So, here are some advanced tips on how to manage, organize, and deal
with your screenplay files.
</p>

<h2>Use Specific File Extensions</h2>

<p>Having been a Mac user until fairly recently (I've since switched
to Linux), I always thought that there was something magical about
file extensions; if you rename an MP3 file to .txt then that file is
destroyed, right?  Actually, as it turns out...no, that's wrong.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing magical or sacred about file extensions.  You can
call a file whatever you want, you simply then have to be explicit
about what the computer should do with that file.
</p>

<p>
That said, it's actually quite helpful to name files with sensible
extensions, because it provides you with more information about that
file, at a glance.  If you name your screenplay files .txt, then they
could be anything from text clippings from an online news article that
you like, or a shopping list, or a screenplay.  So, help yourself out
and call your screenplay files .scp or .screenplay, like this:
</p>

<div class="progralisting">
$ ls ~/Documents
apocalypse1999.scp
priv.scp
relayer.scp
rune.scp
zelda.screenplay
</div>

<p>
It not only tells you more about the file from just looking at it in
your file manager (such as your Finder, or Dolphin, or Nautilus) but
it also helps out when you need to do a search for a file that you've
misplaced.  Hunting for *.scp is a lot easier than trying to remember
what exactly you might have called the fourth revision of the second
draft of your eleventh untitled screenplay.....
</p>

<h2>Assign MIME Types</h2>

<p>
If you followed the Getting Started tutorials on this site, then
GNU Emacs will automatically detect when a .scp or .screenplay file
needs to be opened in screenwriter-mode.  That's good.
</p>

<p>
Your computer, on the other hand, won't know what to do with a .scp or
.screenplay file.  It won't know to open it in Emacs, although it
might auto-detect (if you're running Linux) that it is a text file, so
it might open it in KWrite or gedit.  It is quite useful, therefore,
to let your computer know what application it should open for you when
you click on foo.scp or foo.screenplay.
</p>

<p>
On KDE, for instance, you would first right click on the screenplay
file and choose the <strong>Open With...</strong> option:
</p>

<img src="./advanced/openWith.png" />

<p>
Type in the name of the application to use with this type of file (in
this case, obviously, that would be <strong>emacs</strong>) and make
sure that the box next to <strong>Remember application association for
this type of file</strong> is checked.  From now on, any time you open
a .scp file, it will be opened in Emacs, which will switch over to
screenwriter-mode automatically.
</p>

<img src="./advanced/remember.png" />

<p>
On Mac, select the .scp file and choose the <strong>Get Info</strong>
option from the File menu.  In the Info panel, in the section labeled
<strong>Open With</strong>, select <strong>Other</strong>.
</p>

<p>
An application chooser will appear.  Choose Emacs and make sure that
the <strong>Always Open With</strong> box is checked.
</p>

<p>
From now on, any time you open a .scp file, it will be opened in
Emacs, which will switch over to screenwriter-mode automatically.
</p>

<p>
On Windows, I believe the process is similar but have no Windows
experience to know for sure.
</p>

<h2>Save In Chunks</h2>

<p>
I used to save my screenplays as one file that contained everything
from the title page to the FADE OUT.  This does work but it's actually
not very efficient.  During writing a screenplay as well as after it's
finished, scenes are frequently moved; scene 12 becomes scene 35 and
scene 42 becomes scene 1, and so on.  Making your screenplay a
monolithic file means a lot of confusing searching, scrolling,
copying, and pasting.
</p>

<p>
The answer I use is to save each scene as a new file.  If I need to
move scenes around, I simply open my file manager (Dolphin on KDE,
Finder on Mac OS, Explorer? on Windows), navigate to that screenplay's
folder, and renumber the scene I need to move.  Simple and efficient.
</p>

<p>
Compiling my screenplay in the end is simple.  I simply concatenate
all the scenes together into one document, which can be done in one
simple command on Linux or a the Terminal.app on OS X:
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
$ cat *scp > myGreatScript.screenplay
</div>

<p>
As you can see, I reserve the .screenplay extension for only a final
build of my complete screenplay; the .scp files are therefore the
scene files.
</p>

<p>
For more on these sorts of actions, such as building the screenplay,
numbering scenes for the shooting script, and more, please see the
<strong>screenplay-tools</strong> suite included with screenwriter-mode.
</p>

<h2>Element Databases</h2>

<p>
Some screenwriting software maintains running databases of all the
locations and characters you use as you write.  Then, when you are
typing out a character's name, it auto-suggests names that match what
you seem to be typing.  Well, so does screenwriter-mode.
</p>

<p>
As you write your screenplay, each slug line and character name will
be rememembered for you.  For instance, if we have established a
location called <strong>INT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT</strong> and we want
to recall that exact name later, simply hit <strong>alt-s</strong> to
enter the SLUG LINE mode, and use the arrow keys to scroll through the
different listings of locations you've used.
</p>

<p>
Alternately, you can search the database for locations.  I have GNU
Emacs set so that <strong>control-s</strong> searches my document
forwards and <strong>control-r</strong> searches my document in
reverse.  You may configure yours to do this by adding these lines to
your .emacs file:
</p>

<div class="programlisting">
<p>(global-set-key (kbd "C-S") 'isearch-forward-regexp)</p>
<p>(global-set-key (kbd "C-R") 'isearch-backward-regexp)</p>
</div>

<p>
From now on, you can enter SLUG LINE mode (or CHARACTER in the
DIALOGUE mode), and use <strong>control-r</strong> to search
dynamically through your history of locations as you type; ergo, you
would hit <strong>alt-s</strong> to get into SLUG LINE entry mode,
then <strong>control-r</strong> to start a dynamic search, and then
type the location, hitting <strong>Return</strong> when the location
matches, and <strong>Return</strong> again to insert that slug line
into the script. 
</p>

<h2>Plain Text</h2>

<p>
Many novice computer users under-estimate the power of plain text,
until just a few too many files stop opening up due to the file
format falling out of favor, or the software vendor going out of
business, or your license isn't co-operating that day, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
This is the power of plain text; it can be easily formatted, it is
viewable and editable by any text editor on any platform, and it can
be read by human eyes as well as screen-readers for the blind.
</p>

<p>
Plain text can also be easily parsed, which makes the
<strong>screenplay-tools</strong> suite possible.  With these shell
scripts, it is possible to extract useful production information from
the screenplay and utilize that information during pre-production.
</p>

<h2>Org-Mode Integration</h2>

<p>
Another plug-in for Emacs, called Org-Mode, specializes in
scheduling and task management.  Learning Org-Mode can free you from
the need of complex, expensive scheduling and budgeting software that,
generally, have the same issues as the overly.-complex and expensive
screenwriting software.
</p>

<p>
To that end, screenwriter-mode can integrate on a basic level with
Org-Mode, currently by providing lists of locations and characters in
Org-Mode style formatting (still, naturally, plain text).
